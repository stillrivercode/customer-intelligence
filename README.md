## üéì Document Driven Development (DDD)

### Methodology Overview

DDD transforms traditional development by putting **specifications first**:

1. **Write detailed specifications** for each component
2. **Generate code using AI** from these specifications
3. **Iterate and refine** through testing and validation
4. **Scale efficiently** with consistent patterns

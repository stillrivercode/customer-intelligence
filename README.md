## üéì Document Driven Development (DDD)

### Methodology Overview

DDD transforms traditional development by putting **specifications first**:

1. **Write detailed specifications** for each component
2. **Generate code using AI** from these specifications
3. **Iterate and refine** through testing and validation
4. **Scale efficiently** with consistent patterns

### Workshop Benefits

**For Developers:**
- Learn cutting-edge AI-assisted development
- Master specification writing for better code quality
- Experience modern React and TypeScript patterns
- Build portfolio-worthy customer intelligence platform

**For Organizations:**
- Evaluate DDD methodology for team adoption
- Assess AI-powered development productivity gains
- Understand customer success platform architecture
- Pilot advanced development workflows

## ‚öôÔ∏è GitHub Configuration

### Required Repository Secrets

To enable AI-powered workflows (code reviews, etc.), configure these secrets in your repository settings:

- **`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`** - Your API key from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) for AI code reviews
  - Required for the AI PR Review workflow to function
  - Get your key at: https://openrouter.ai/keys

### Optional Repository Variables

- **`AI_MODEL`** - The AI model to use for reviews (defaults to `anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet`)
  - Example values: `google/gemini-2.5-pro`, `openai/gpt-4-turbo`

// Implement proper data pagination
const usePaginatedData = (fetchFn, pageSize = 10) => {
  const [data, setData] = useState([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
  const [hasMore, setHasMore] = useState(true);
  
  const loadMore = useCallback(async () => {
    if (loading || !hasMore) return;
    
    setLoading(true);
    try {
      const newData = await fetchFn(data.length, pageSize);
      setData(prev => [...prev, ...newData]);
      setHasMore(newData.length === pageSize);
    } finally {
      setLoading(false);
    }
  }, [data.length, fetchFn, loading, hasMore, pageSize]);
  
  return { data, loading, hasMore, loadMore };
};
```
